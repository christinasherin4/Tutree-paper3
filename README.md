Q1. Union and Intersection of two sorted arrays.

Given two sorted arrays, find their union and intersection.

Input : arr1[] = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7} arr2[] = {2, 3, 5, 6} 
Output :
Union : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} 
Intersection : {3, 5} 

Input : arr1[] = {2, 5, 6} arr2[] = {4, 6, 8, 10} 
Output : 
Union : {2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10} 
Intersection : {6}


Q2. Program for array rotation.

Write a function rotate(arr[], d, n) that rotates arr[] of size n by d elements.
Rotation of the above array by 2 will make array

Input: arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, n = 6, d = 2
Output: arr[] = {3,4,5,6,1,2}
